# Task 1
# Flask Application Deployment on Kubernetes

This repository contains a simple Flask application and the necessary configuration files to deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster using Docker, Terraform, and Kubernetes manifests.

## Project Structure

```
├── app.py # Flask application
├── Dockerfile # Dockerfile to containerize the Flask app
├── version.txt # File to keep track of application version
├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies
├── deployment.yaml # Kubernetes Deployment manifest
├── service.yaml # Kubernetes Service manifest
├── terraform/ # Directory containing Terraform scripts for Kubernetes cluster provisioning
└── .github/workflows/ # CI/CD pipeline configuration
```

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: To build and push the Docker image.
- **Kubernetes**: A running Kubernetes cluster.
- **kubectl**: To manage Kubernetes resources.
- **Terraform**: If provisioning the Kubernetes cluster with Terraform.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline configured in `.github/workflows/`.

## Setup

### 1. Build the Docker Image

Build and tag the Docker image for the Flask application.

```bash
docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/my-flask-app:v1 .
```

2. Push the Docker Image

Push the Docker image to Docker Hub (or any other container registry).

```bash
docker push your-dockerhub-username/my-flask-app:v1
```
3. Kubernetes Deployment
Deploy the Application

Apply the Kubernetes Deployment manifest to create the application pods:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
Expose the Application

Apply the Kubernetes Service manifest to expose the application:

```bash

kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```
4. Access the Application

Depending on the type of service you used (ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer), access the application as follows:

- ClusterIP: Access internally using the service name.
- NodePort: Access externally using http://NodeIP:NodePort.
LoadBalancer: Access using the external IP provided by the cloud provider.

5. CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is configured to automate the following stages:

- Cluster Provisioning: Provision a local or managed Kubernetes cluster using Terraform.
- Versioning: Increment the application version automatically on each push to the main branch.
- Build and Push: Build the Docker image and push it to the container registry.
- Deployment: Deploy the latest version of the application to the Kubernetes cluster.

The pipeline is triggered on every push to the main branch.

6. Versioning

The versioning process is automated. The current version is stored in the version.txt file and is automatically incremented on every push to the main branch.

## Components

### 1. Frontend (NextJS)
- **Description**: The frontend is developed using NextJS and is responsible for the user interface of the POS system. It interacts with users and sends their requests to the backend through APIs.
- **Deployment**: Deployed on a Kubernetes cluster for scalability and high availability.
- **Access**: Accessible via a Load Balancer to manage incoming traffic and distribute it across multiple instances.

### 2. Backend (Java Spring Boot)
- **Description**: The backend consists of microservices developed using Java Spring Boot. It handles the business logic, processes user requests, and interacts with the database for data persistence.
- **API Gateway**: Exposes REST APIs that are consumed by both the frontend and the mobile application.
- **Deployment**: Also deployed on the Kubernetes cluster to ensure consistent performance and fault tolerance.

### 3. Mobile Application (Flutter)
- **Description**: The mobile application is developed using Flutter and serves as a mobile interface for the POS system. It interacts with the backend services through secure APIs.
- **Communication**: Uses the same REST APIs provided by the backend to perform transactions and other operations.

### 4. Kubernetes Cluster (GKE)
- **Description**: The Kubernetes cluster, managed through Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), hosts both the frontend and backend services. It automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Networking**: Includes a VPC with public and private subnets, providing secure communication between components.

### 5. Database
- **Description**: A managed SQL database that stores transactional data for the POS system. It is accessed by the backend services for data operations.
- **Deployment**: Hosted in a private subnet to ensure security and data integrity.

### 6. Monitoring & Alerting
- **Monitoring Tools**: 
  - **Prometheus**: Used for collecting and storing metrics from the application and infrastructure.
  - **Grafana**: Provides a dashboard for visualizing the metrics and monitoring the system's health.
- **Alerting**: 
  - **Alertmanager**: Configured to send alerts when certain thresholds are breached, ensuring timely notification of issues.
- **Centralized Logging**: 
  - **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: Used for aggregating and analyzing logs from different components to facilitate troubleshooting and performance optimization.

  ## Flow

### 1. User Interaction
- **Web Interface**: Users interact with the POS system through the web-based frontend developed in NextJS.
- **Mobile Interface**: Alternatively, users can access the system via the mobile application built using Flutter.

### 2. API Communication
- **Frontend to Backend**: 
  - User requests initiated from the frontend are sent to the backend services via REST APIs.
  - The backend processes these requests, performing necessary business logic and operations.
- **Mobile to Backend**:
  - Similarly, the mobile application communicates with the backend through secure REST APIs, allowing users to perform transactions and access services.

### 3. Data Processing
- **Backend Services**:
  - The backend services, powered by Java Spring Boot, handle all the business logic.
  - They interact with the managed SQL database to retrieve, store, or update transactional data as required by user requests.
- **Database Operations**:
  - All critical data operations are performed on a secure and managed SQL database, ensuring data integrity and consistency across the system.

### 4. Monitoring
- **Metrics Collection**:
  - Prometheus continuously collects metrics from the frontend, backend, and infrastructure components.
- **Real-Time Visualization**:
  - Grafana provides real-time dashboards to visualize the collected metrics, giving insights into system performance.
- **Alerting**:
  - Alertmanager is configured to trigger alerts based on predefined thresholds, ensuring any critical issues are promptly addressed.
- **Log Management**:
  - Logs from all components are aggregated in a centralized logging system (ELK Stack) for analysis, troubleshooting, and performance tuning.

### 5. User Feedback
- **Response to User**:
  - After processing the request, the backend services send the appropriate response back to the frontend or mobile application.
  - The user interface then updates to reflect the results of the operation, providing feedback to the user.

This flow ensures a seamless and secure operation of the POS system, from user interaction to backend processing and monitoring.
