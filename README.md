## Components

### 1. Frontend (NextJS)
- **Description**: The frontend is developed using NextJS and is responsible for the user interface of the POS system. It interacts with users and sends their requests to the backend through APIs.
- **Deployment**: Deployed on a Kubernetes cluster for scalability and high availability.
- **Access**: Accessible via a Load Balancer to manage incoming traffic and distribute it across multiple instances.

### 2. Backend (Java Spring Boot)
- **Description**: The backend consists of microservices developed using Java Spring Boot. It handles the business logic, processes user requests, and interacts with the database for data persistence.
- **API Gateway**: Exposes REST APIs that are consumed by both the frontend and the mobile application.
- **Deployment**: Also deployed on the Kubernetes cluster to ensure consistent performance and fault tolerance.

### 3. Mobile Application (Flutter)
- **Description**: The mobile application is developed using Flutter and serves as a mobile interface for the POS system. It interacts with the backend services through secure APIs.
- **Communication**: Uses the same REST APIs provided by the backend to perform transactions and other operations.

### 4. Kubernetes Cluster (GKE)
- **Description**: The Kubernetes cluster, managed through Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), hosts both the frontend and backend services. It automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Networking**: Includes a VPC with public and private subnets, providing secure communication between components.

### 5. Database
- **Description**: A managed SQL database that stores transactional data for the POS system. It is accessed by the backend services for data operations.
- **Deployment**: Hosted in a private subnet to ensure security and data integrity.

### 6. Monitoring & Alerting
- **Monitoring Tools**: 
  - **Prometheus**: Used for collecting and storing metrics from the application and infrastructure.
  - **Grafana**: Provides a dashboard for visualizing the metrics and monitoring the system's health.
- **Alerting**: 
  - **Alertmanager**: Configured to send alerts when certain thresholds are breached, ensuring timely notification of issues.
- **Centralized Logging**: 
  - **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: Used for aggregating and analyzing logs from different components to facilitate troubleshooting and performance optimization.

  ## Flow

### 1. User Interaction
- **Web Interface**: Users interact with the POS system through the web-based frontend developed in NextJS.
- **Mobile Interface**: Alternatively, users can access the system via the mobile application built using Flutter.

### 2. API Communication
- **Frontend to Backend**: 
  - User requests initiated from the frontend are sent to the backend services via REST APIs.
  - The backend processes these requests, performing necessary business logic and operations.
- **Mobile to Backend**:
  - Similarly, the mobile application communicates with the backend through secure REST APIs, allowing users to perform transactions and access services.

### 3. Data Processing
- **Backend Services**:
  - The backend services, powered by Java Spring Boot, handle all the business logic.
  - They interact with the managed SQL database to retrieve, store, or update transactional data as required by user requests.
- **Database Operations**:
  - All critical data operations are performed on a secure and managed SQL database, ensuring data integrity and consistency across the system.

### 4. Monitoring
- **Metrics Collection**:
  - Prometheus continuously collects metrics from the frontend, backend, and infrastructure components.
- **Real-Time Visualization**:
  - Grafana provides real-time dashboards to visualize the collected metrics, giving insights into system performance.
- **Alerting**:
  - Alertmanager is configured to trigger alerts based on predefined thresholds, ensuring any critical issues are promptly addressed.
- **Log Management**:
  - Logs from all components are aggregated in a centralized logging system (ELK Stack) for analysis, troubleshooting, and performance tuning.

### 5. User Feedback
- **Response to User**:
  - After processing the request, the backend services send the appropriate response back to the frontend or mobile application.
  - The user interface then updates to reflect the results of the operation, providing feedback to the user.

This flow ensures a seamless and secure operation of the POS system, from user interaction to backend processing and monitoring.
